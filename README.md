# Introduction to Computer Science - Fall 2017
## Lab 1 - You need to Git

**Purpose:** This purpose of this lab is to get some practice with basic _HTML_ and the basics of the _Git Version Control System (VCS)_. The assignment has two parts. The HTML part and the git part.

**Part 1 - Instructions:** Create a basic HTML file. It should be an informative page about an animal of your choice (real or fictional). The HTML file will include the most important structural elements, including:

* Doctype declaration
* &lt;html&gt; angle tags
* &lt;head&gt; tags with typical title and meta-data tags
* &lt;body&gt; tags with content using appropriate markup.

Other tags that the page should demonstrate:
* &lt;h1&gt; at least one heading tag
* &lt;ol&gt; or &lt;ul&gt;, ordered or unordered list
* &lt;p&gt; paragraph tags where appropriate
* &lt;img&gt; tag and an image (the actual image file can be a link to another page, or a local file in the same folder)

When the page is completed, ensure that you push it back to your repository using the method of your choice. If you have set up a GUI GitHub client on your computer, you should have no trouble uploading it to your repository. However, if you are using a command shell like PowerShell (Windows) or Bash (Linux), then the commands are as follows:

`````
    $ git add --all
    $ git commit -m "Some commit message."
    $ git push -u origin master
`````

If you have trouble with these commands, ask the instructor or refer to the provided course resources.
